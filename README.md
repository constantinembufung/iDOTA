# iDOTA
iDOTA is AI-based retinal screening application that is developed at the Douala School of AI Research Lab(DSAIRLab) to easily diagnose and prevent blindness in Cameroon.   
According to the WHO,  the number of people of all ages visually impaired is estimated to be 285 million, of whom 39 million are blind. People 50 years and older are 82% of all blind. The major causes of visual impairment are uncorrected refractive errors (43%) and cataract (33%); the first cause of blindness is cataract (51%).
The Need: 
Over 85% of the Cameroonian population are not screened for retinal disease
Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of blindness among working aged adults. We hopes to detect and prevent this disease among people living in rural areas where medical screening is difficult to conduct.
Diabetic retinopathy affects blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissue called the retina that lines the back of the eye. It is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetes and the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults. 

Our solution: 
Screening all high risk patients with our easy-to-use, AI-based retinal screening system hence early diagnose and prevention.
Our solution is simple and accurate & takes less than 1 minute to complete at your clinic!.
